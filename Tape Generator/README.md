# Tape Generator

I had two attempts at writing a generator for the virtual tapes.

## Python

## Website

Because the creation of the Matrix Case is the most important aspect of tape generation, the text implementation in Python caused me no end of problems - mainly because the person who assembles the physical matrix case really needs to be the person who builds the layout.

My solution was a web version of the matrix case editor - which evolved into a full site to both build the matrix case as well as generate the tape itself.
