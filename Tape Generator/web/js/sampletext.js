        changed. With the brass nozzle in his fists, with this great python spitting its
        venomous kerosene upon the world, the blood pounded in his head, and his hands
        were the hands of some amazing conductor playing all the symphonies of blazing and
        5 burning to bring down the tatters and charcoal ruins of history. With his symbolic
        helmet numbered 451 on his solid head, and his eyes all orange flame with the thought
        of what came next, he flicked the igniter and the house jumped up in a gorging fire
        that burned the evening sky red and yellow and black. He strode in a swarm of fireflies.
        He wanted above all, like the old joke, to shove a marshmallow on a stick in the
        10 furnace, while the flapping pigeon-winged books died on the porch and lawn of the
        house. While the books went up in sparkling whirls and blew away on a wind turned
        dark with burning.`]

        no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail 
        about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen 
        and regulating the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth; whenever it 
        is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find myself involuntarily pausing before coffin 
        warehouses, and bringing up the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get 
        such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to prevent me from deliberately 
        stepping into the street, and methodically knocking people's hats off—then, I account it high time to 
        get to sea as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a philosophical flourish 
        Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. 
        If they but knew it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very nearly the same 
        feelings towards the ocean with me.`]
