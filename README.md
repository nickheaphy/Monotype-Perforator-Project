# The Monotype Perforator Project

Apparently the *Monotype Electronic Perforator* is a pretty rare beast. The [Printing Muesum](http://www.theprintingmuseum.org.nz/) managed to obtain a full model from Melbourne and I was entrusted with the *31 Channel Tape Punch* as I thought that I would be able to interface it with a modern computer to allow the punching of tapes.

This turned out to be a lot more complex than I expected and it is still a work in progress.

I actually don't expect most of this project to be much use to anyone as unless you have a tape punch unit (or maybe have built a interface between a [computer and a composition caster](https://github.com/keriszafir/rpi2caster))

## Components

There are a number of things that make up this project. I have tried to separate them out logically (though debatable if I have been successful)

- [Perforator Repair](Perforator%20Repair) - a writeup of repairing the perforator.
- [Interface](Interface) - contains the microcontoller that physically connects the perforator to the computer.
- [Tape Generator](Tape%20Generator) - contains tooling to generate the virtual tape for punching
- [Tape Punch](Tape%Punch) - contains tooling to actually send virtual tape to the [Interface](Interface) for punching.


## Reference Material

There are a number of books and brochures and whitepapers that I have found while learning about the perforator. I have downloaded or scanned these items and put into the [Reference](Reference) folder.
